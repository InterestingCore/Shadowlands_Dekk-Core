for creature_template convert:

need to remove 14x   0 value before 'SmartAI' value 
and the second 0 to back from scriptname

it's because creature_template_spell contains now the npc spells! and other things changed
if u (obiously me) see a big number in the 14 value before smartai it's spell so need to add to creature_template_spell



for smart_scripts convert:

add one more 0 value before comment column (last) 
its the orientation column which is added recently
